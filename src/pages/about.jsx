                        &emsp;The "Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects" challenge involves building a web-based orrery that visualizes real-time positions of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using 3D models, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) for interactive experiences. Users can explore the solar system, observe NEO movements, and interact with celestial bodies through AR and VR, making it an educational and immersive tool for understanding space. Additionally, the app integrates a gamified component called AstroDefend, where players can strategize planetary defense against potential asteroid threats, combining real-time data with a fun, engaging experience to raise awareness about planetary defense.

                        &emsp;An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system that illustrates the relative positions, motions, and sometimes the sizes of the planets and moons around the Sun. It serves as a visual and interactive representation of celestial movements, allowing people to understand the orbital dynamics of planets and other objects in space. Traditionally, orreries are constructed using a series of gears, rods, and wheels that simulate the planetary orbits. These mechanical components are carefully designed to replicate the orbital periods and movements in real-time or at a sped-up rate for demonstration purposes.

                    <p>
                        &emsp;In modern times, orreries have evolved beyond physical models into computer-generated 3D models, offering even greater flexibility and precision. These digital orreries simulate the solar system using advanced software, allowing users to explore planetary positions and movements from any angle and in any time frame. By leveraging 3D graphics and real-time data, virtual orreries can depict not only planets and moons but also asteroids and other near-Earth objects, making them powerful tools for education, research, and interactive learning in both desktop and VR/AR environments.
